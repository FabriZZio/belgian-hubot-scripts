## Belgian Hubot Scripts

This is a collection of Belgian hubot scripts. They are probably not of any use 
if you don't live in belgium or if you don't speak dutch or french. However, if you do, then
these scripts will supercharge your hubot experience.

The initial set of scripts originated at [Marlon](http://www.marlon.be)

### Contributing

Yes, please do! We're not picky, we just want to make our hubot better, and yours too. 

There are only 3 constraints:

* Your scripts should have a documentation header describing what they
  do and what commands they provide.

* The scripts you submit should not some company specific. So no employee
  names or inside jokes please.

* They should be specific to belgium.

### Testing the scripts

Testing is easy. Simply make sure you install hubot, this can be done by 
simply executing 

    npm install

in the root folder of this project.

Once that is done, you can execute

    ./run-test.sh 
    
to test the hubot scripts inside your shell.
